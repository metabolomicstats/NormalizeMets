Description: Metabolomics data are inevitably subject to a component of unwanted
    variation, due to factors such as batch effects, matrix effects, and confounding
    biological variation. This package is a collection of functions designed to 
    implement, assess, and choose a suitable normalization method 
    for a given metabolomics study (De Livera et al (2015) <doi:10.1021/ac502439y>).
