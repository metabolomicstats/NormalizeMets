abstract = {Most mass spectrometry based metabolomics studies are semiquantitative and depend on efficient normalization techniques to suppress systematic error. A common approach is to include isotope-labeled internal standards (ISs) and then express the estimated metabolite abundances relative to the IS. Because of problems such as insufficient chromatographic resolution, however, the analytes may directly influence estimates of the IS, a phenomenon known as cross-contribution (CC). Normalization using ISs that suffer from CC effects will cause significant loss of information if the interfering analytes are associated with the studied factors. We present a novel normalization algorithm, which compensates for systematic CC effects that can be traced back to a linear association with the experimental design. The proposed method was found to be superior at purifying the signal of interest compared to current normalization methods when applied to two biological data sets and a multicomponent dilution mixture. Our method is applicable to data from randomized and designed experiments that use ISs to monitor the systematic error.},

abstract = {Metabolomics experiments are inevitably subject to a component of unwanted variation, due to factors such as batch effects, long runs of samples, and confounding biological variation. Although the removal of this unwanted variation is a vital step in the analysis of metabolomics data, it is considered a gray area in which there is a recognised need to develop a better understanding of the procedures and statistical methods required to achieve statistically relevant optimal biological outcomes. In this paper, we discuss the causes of unwanted variation in metabolomics experiments, review commonly used metabolomics approaches for handling this unwanted variation, and present a statistical approach for the removal of unwanted variation to obtain normalized metabolomics data. The advantages and performance of the approach relative to several widely-used metabolomics normalization approaches are illustrated through two metabolomics studies, and recommendations are provided for choosing and assessing the most suitable normalization method for a given metabolomics experiment. Software for the approach is made freely available.},

@article{Fukushima2013,
abstract = {Large-scale "omics" data, such as microarrays, can be used to infer underlying cellular regulatory networks in organisms, enabling us to better understand the molecular basis of disease and important traits. Correlation approaches, such as a hierarchical cluster analysis, have been widely used to analyze omics data. In addition to the changes in the mean levels of molecules in the omics data, it is important to know about the changes in the correlation relationship among molecules between 2 experimental conditions. The development of a tool to identify differential correlation patterns in omics data in an efficient and unbiased manner is therefore desirable. We developed the DiffCorr package, a simple method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks, which builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient. DiffCorr calculates correlation matrices for each dataset, identifies the first principal component-based "eigen-molecules" in the correlation networks, and tests differential correlation between the 2 groups based on Fisher's z-test. We illustrated its utility by demonstrating biologically relevant, differentially correlated molecules in transcriptome coexpression and metabolite-to-metabolite correlation networks. DiffCorr can explore differential correlations between 2 conditions in the context of post-genomics data types, namely transcriptomics and metabolomics. DiffCorr is simple to use in calculating differential correlations and is suitable for the first step towards inferring causal relationships and detecting biomarker candidates. The package can be downloaded from the following website: http://diffcorr.sourceforge.net/.},

abstract = {Metabolomics research often requires the use of multiple analytical platforms, batches of samples, and laboratories, any of which can introduce a component of unwanted variation. In addition, every experiment is subject to within-platform and other experimental variation, which often includes unwanted biological variation. Such variation must be removed in order to focus on the biological information of interest. We present a broadly applicable method for the removal of unwanted variation arising from various sources for the identification of differentially abundant metabolites and, hence, for the systematic integration of data on the same quantities from different sources. We illustrate the versatility and the performance of the approach in four applications, and we show that it has several advantages over the existing normalization methods.},

abstract = {The usual aim in metabolomic studies is to quantify the entire metabolome of each of a series of biological samples. To do this for complex biological matrices, e.g., plant tissues, efficient and reproducible extraction protocols must be developed. However, derivatization protocols must also be developed if GC/MS (one of the mostly widely used analytical methods for metabolomics) is involved. The aim of this study was to investigate how different chemical and physical factors (extraction solvent, derivatization reagents, and temperature) affect the extraction and derivatization of the metabolome from leaves of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Using design of experiment procedures, variation was systematically introduced, and the effects of this variation were analyzed using regression models. The results show that this approach allows a reliable protocol for metabolomic analysis of Arabidopsis to be determined with a relatively limited number of experiments. Following two different investigations an extraction and derivatization protocol was chosen. Further, the reproducibility of the analysis of 66 endogenous compounds was investigated, and it was shown that both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds were detected with high reproducibility.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the past decade, the identification of gene co-expression has become a routine part of the analysis of high-dimensional microarray data. Gene co-expression, which is mostly detected via the Pearson correlation coefficient, has played an important role in the discovery of molecular pathways and networks. Unfortunately, the presence of systematic noise in high-dimensional microarray datasets corrupts estimates of gene co-expression. Removing systematic noise from microarray data is therefore crucial. Many cleaning approaches for microarray data exist, however these methods are aimed towards improving differential expression analysis and their performances have been primarily tested for this application. To our knowledge, the performances of these approaches have never been systematically compared in the context of gene co-expression estimation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using simulations we demonstrate that standard cleaning procedures, such as background correction and quantile normalization, fail to adequately remove systematic noise that affects gene co-expression and at times further degrade true gene co-expression. Instead we show that a global version of removal of unwanted variation (RUV), a data-driven approach, removes systematic noise but also allows the estimation of the true underlying gene-gene correlations. We compare the performance of all noise removal methods when applied to five large published datasets on gene expression in the human brain. RUV retrieves the highest gene co-expression values for sets of genes known to interact, but also provides the greatest consistency across all five datasets. We apply the method to prioritize epileptic encephalopathy candidate genes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our work raises serious concerns about the quality of many published gene co-expression analyses. RUV provides an efficient and flexible way to remove systematic noise from high-dimensional microarray datasets when the objective is gene co-expression analysis. The RUV method as applicable in the context of gene-gene correlation estimation is available as a BioconductoR-package: RUVcorr.},
